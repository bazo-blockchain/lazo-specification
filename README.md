# Lazo: Language Specification

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bazo-blockchain/lazo-specification.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bazo-blockchain/lazo-specification)

The Bazo Blockchain is a research blockchain to test different mechanisms and algorithms. In the current version, a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm and mechanisms to run the blockchain on mobile devices are integrated. Furthermore, there is also a virtual machine available to interpret and execute IL codes on the Bazo Blockchain. The goal of this study work is to specify a smart contract language for the Bazo Blochchain.


**Result**:
* Language specification - in progress
* [Lazo grammar in AntLR](syntax-antlr/src/main/antlr/Lazo.g4)
* [Contract examples](examples/)
